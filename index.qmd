# 👋 Welcome

This webpage is **under development**.  

Our goal is to build a collection of resources that use **R code** and **mathematical explanations** to make concepts in statistical modeling easier to understand.  

We will begin with the basics of **linear models**, and progressively extend toward more advanced **mixed models**, which are widely applied in plant breeding, animal breeding, and many other fields.  

## What to Expect

- 📊 **Hands-on examples**: R scripts that you can run and adapt.  
- 🧮 **Step-by-step math**: showing how model equations connect to code.  
- 🧑 **Conceptual explanations**: to make sense of sums of squares, design matrices, likelihood, variance components, mixed models equations, heritability, and more in the context of plant breeding.
